# numGuesser
This is a Python WebApp template with Flask + Bootstrap.

numGuesser request a value between 0 - 10000000000 and the app guesses the number asking if it's the correct number or, otherwise, if it's higher or lower.

It uses: 
- Python 3.8.10 
- Flask as a backend framework to run the webapp.
- Bootstrap as frontend framework to style and handle the alerts.
- HTML to create Flask templates.
- CSS to style the rest of the frontend.
- JS to be able to submit the form with an <a> tag.
